*Spike Lee master class for Mizzou J-School, at RJI April 4, 2016:*


--------
(25:50) Growing up  had no idea I wanted to be a filmaker. I liked films. But I had no idea people made films.

We just went to the movie movie theatre. We go every Saturday, a double bill. We would get there when it opens. And we would stay till our mothers drag us out of the theatre.

We would drink all the soda we could drink, popcorn, candy, and throw stuff at the screen and just have a good time.

I went to John Dewey High School, Coney Island. And it was expected I go to college because my father and grandfather went to Morehouse,. Atlanta, Georgia. My mother and grandmother went to Spelman. My father was a freshman; Dr. Martin Luther King was a senior. And his son, Martin Luther King, III -- his son -- and I were in the same class, and also Jeh Johnson who runs Homeland Security, were all in the class of 1979. Also Derrick Stafford, he's an NBA ref -- I saw him the other night when we loost to Indiana.

Came to school. I was a miserable student. It wasn't that I wasn't smart; I was not motivated. My freshman and sophomore years I was a D+/C– student, barely making it.

And at the end of my  sophomore year, before it was time to go back to New York for the summer, my advisor asked to see me. She told I have to choose a major when I come back in the fall, my junior year.

I said why.

She said because you;ve exhausted all your electives.

Came back to New York, the summer changed my life, the summer of 1977. New York City was broke. And you have the Daily News headline showing  President Ford, it said "Ford to City: Drop Dead."

And I expected to have a summer job, make some money. Buy some clothes, sneakers and go back to school. But there were no jobs.

And I knew this women, her name is Vietta Johnson. She was always very smart.

In New York City, to get in the good public high schools you had to take a test. And the three schools were Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, and Brooklyn Tech. And Vietta, she was mad smart. In sixth grade she was talking about being a doctor, which she is now. IN sixth grade she already knew what she wanted to do, and she did it.

So I'm sitting on my stoop -- we don't call them porches in Brooklyn, it's a stoop; it's a Dutch word. So I'm sitting on my stoop. Nothing to do. And I say let me go see what Vietta is doing. This is before cellphones, summer of '77.

So I walked a couple blocks to where she lives, in (???)Towers. So I ring the bell. She says come on' up. So we're sitting in her living room, on the sofa, and I see a box in the corner of the living room. I said What is that?

She said someone gave me a Super 8 camera. You can have it if you want it.

Then I looked in the other corner of the room and there's a box. I said what in that box.

She said that's the film for the camera.

So now I have something to do for the summer.

So I spent the whole summer running around New York City filming stuff.

New York City had a crazy, crazy heat wave. Consequently, Con Edison could not handle the demand. And there was a blackout for two days.

Black folks and Puerto Ricans went crazy, looting, and all that stuff.

And it was also the first summer of disco. So every block on the weekend had a block party. DJs would take out their turntables, the wheels of steel. Hook the turntables up the streetlamps, and speakers. And people danced.

And then there was a guy named Son of Sam, the forty-four caliber killer. His name was David Berkewitz.

New York City was crazy that summer. And this guy was going around killing people.

Now, black New Yorkers and Nuyorican were not scared, because -- this was before gentrification. And Dave Berkewitz was not going up into Harlem or the South Bronx or Bed-Sty. So we knew were cool. Not that we didn't care about people getting murdered.

So I went back to school and I declared my major. Morehouse did not have a film major, but across the street was Clark College -- which is now Clark Atlanta University. All these black schools were across the street from one another. Morehouse, Spelman, which my mother and grandmother went to, Clark.

So I chose my major: mass communications, which was film, radio, print journalism, and, something else I forgot. And the teacher, his name was Dr. Herb Eichelberger -- he's still teaching. I called him Dr. Ike.

I said I got this stuff I shot this summer: I don't know what to do with it.

He said what don't make a documentary on it?

I said cool.

So I spent the whole fall semester of my junior year editing the film. Dr. Eichelberger was the only one with the key to the film lab. And many times when it was time for him to go home, he would would stay three, four, five hours, so I could continue to edit. And he wasn't getting paid extra.

End of fall semester, I showed the film to my class. They liked it. That was a great feeling being in the back of the room and have somebody respond to something I made. I never have doen that before.

Fromt hat moment on, I decided to be a filmmaker. And anything short of robbing a back or killing somebody, I was going to do whatever I do -- all legal -- to be a filmmaker.

And my junior and senior years, I was an A+ student. Sophomore and freshman, D+/C–.

I didn't get smart all of a sudden. I was motivated.

I was lost in the sauce. I didn't know what I was doing. I wasn't motivated. When you're not motivated you don't really care if you gonna fail. You're not gonna really work hard.

But now, that's my major. If I had to have a ten hour editing session, I was fine with it.

So after my senior year I knew that this classic story of moving to Hollywood and working yourself up from the mail room doesn't work for black people. No. That was not gonna be a route for me. I had to do -- in football term -- I had to do an end-around. A misdirection play, I had to go though independent cinema to further my education, because there's still a lot I needed to know.

So I applied to the top three film schools in America: AFI, American Film Institute; USC, the Trojans; and NYU.

But to gain admittance into USC and AFI, you had to get an astronomical score on the GRE. I took the test, and I didn't get that score.

Lucky for me the more progressive, forward-thinking people at New York University believed my test score should not be the only way to determine whether someone belongs or not.

At NYU you had to submit a great portfolio. And I got in.

That was the summer of 1979. And I haven't stopped since. Thank you.
